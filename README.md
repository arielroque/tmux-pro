## :paintbrush: Customization

We know that customizing Tmux your way is important, so let's show you how easy it is with Tmux Pro


#### Open Tmux Configuration

It is from this configuration file that we will customize Tmux Pro. We'll use [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) as a text editor, but you can use another one like [Nano](https://github.com/madnight/nano) or even [Visual Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

```bash
#Open tmux config in yout System
vim ~/.tmux.config
```

#### Color Theme

In the configuration file, you will have a section called [color theme]() like this one here

```bash
######################
###  COLOR THEME   ###
######################

background_color='#282a36'
foreground_color='#f8f8f2'
current_line_color='#44475a'
primary_color='#1f4287'
...
...
```

We use color variables to change the text color and customize the background. To choose a new color, you can use this [website](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) to get the hexadecimal color that represents it.
